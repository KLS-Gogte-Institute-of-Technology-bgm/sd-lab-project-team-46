Snap_And_Share
Project Description:
As the students in engineering colleges are asked to buy some mandatory and  common materials like drafter, container, boiler suits, calculators etc where these materials after some time are of no use for some students because of the change in stream or because of no use of the materials in the upcoming subjects . So this web application named ‘snap_and_share’ provides a platform for the students where they can sell these used materials, where as on the other end the students who are in need of these materials can easily buy through this platform at lower cost  instead of buying the new one. Thus the students buying as well as selling both are profitable.
